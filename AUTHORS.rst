This project was started by David Wheeler.

It was initially born out of the need to share files with a Japanese customer, and grew from a relatively naive translation of a test plan document in Excel, to a more comprehensive translation of the test report in Word and the customer readout presentation in PowerPoint.

The key learning from this exercise is the power of the Open Source community.  The initial release was possible literally as a result of standing on the shoulders of giants.  Proof point: with the XLSX and DOCX code stable, the initial implementation of PPTX format support took less than 90 minutes from first opening the python-pptx docs.  Kudos to all.

This is a new project and others are welcome to participate.  Participants in the project are (in alphabetical order):
